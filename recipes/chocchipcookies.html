  <h1>Description</h1>
  <p>Chocolate chip cookies are a classic afternoon tea treat made from buttery dough studded with chunks of melted chocolate. We’ve tried so many tweaks and variations over the years (with a few fails along the way) to try and nail the best chocolate chip cookie recipe, but we think we’ve finally cracked it!</p>
  <h1>Ingredients</h1>
  <ul>
    <li>150g butter, softened</li>
    <li>1/2 cup brown sugar</li>
    <li>1/2 cup caster sugar</li>
    <li>1 egg</li>
    <li>1 tsp vanilla extract</li>
    <li>1 3/4 cups plain flour</li>
    <li>1/2 cup milk chocolate bits</li>
    <li>1/2 cup dark chocolate bits</li>
    <li>1 tbsp extra milk chocolate chips</li>
    <li>1 tbsp extra dark chocolate chips</li>
  </ul>
  <h1>Method</h1>
  <ol>
    <li>Preheat oven to 180C or 160C fan-forced. Line 2 baking trays with baking paper. Using an electric mixer or whisking by hand, beat butter, brown sugar and caster sugar for 1-2 minutes or until smooth and well combined. Beat in egg and vanilla until combined.</li>
    <li>Stir in flour. Stir in milk choc bits and dark choc bits. Roll 2 level tablespoonfuls of mixture into balls and place on prepared trays, 3cm apart. Press down slightly. Decorate with extra dark choc bits and extra milk choc chips.</li>
    <li>Bake for 15-18 minutes or until light golden and cooked. Transfer to a wire rack to cool. Store in an airtight container for up to 1 week.</li>
  </ol>
